Doc Brown is out of town, and he left you the keys to the DeLorean! But do you know enough to get the time machine up to 88mph?

Test your knowledge of the classic 1985 comedy with this fun, interactive trivia game. The more questions you answer correctly, the faster you'll go! But be careful -- wrong answers will result in a speed penalty!
